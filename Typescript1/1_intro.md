# Introduction
## What is Typescript?
=> Better version of javascript.
with more features.

or 

=> Typescript is superset of javascript.
All features of javascritp.
and Extra features and functionality.

## Why Typescript?
=> We can define datatypes (static typing)
(after defining a data type for a varibale ts does not allow to put another type of data)
It improves code maintanability.
Advance features.
Code quality.

## Important typescript features

Define Datatype
Interfaces
Decorator
Generacis
Namespaces
Type Inference

### Short Note on TypeScript

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds extra features to make programming safer and more efficient. All JavaScript code can run in TypeScript, but TypeScript provides additional capabilities such as static typing and advanced tools.

The main purpose of TypeScript is to reduce errors in large applications. By allowing developers to define data types for variables, TypeScript ensures that a variable cannot store a different type of value later. This helps detect errors at compile time instead of runtime, improving code quality and maintainability.

TypeScript also supports features like interfaces, generics, decorators, namespaces, and type inference. These features help in writing structured, reusable, and scalable code. Overall, TypeScript makes JavaScript development more reliable and suitable for large-scale software projects.
